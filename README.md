# README Generator
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.
## Description 
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The README includes the title of the project, a description, table of contents, installation instructions, how to use the project, the licenses with the project, contributing notes, and the project creator's information. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command: **node develop/index.js**

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
